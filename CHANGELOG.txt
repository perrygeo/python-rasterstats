0.12dev
- zone_func argument to apply a function to the masked array before computing stats

0.11
- change `band_num` parameter to `band`
- add example of multiprocessing
- updated for compatibility with upcoming Rasterio 1.0 release
- using latest pytest and pytest-cov for testing
- overhauled NaN handling logic to treat them directly as nodata

0.10.3
- initial attempt at nan logic

0.10.2
- Setup.py bugfix: Include requirements in manifest

0.10.1
- Bug fix for geopandas dataframes

0.10.0
- Added a generator variant of zonal_stats (gen_zonal_stats) and point_query
(gen_point_query) which yield results instead of returning a list
- Dependency on cligj to standardize the geojson input/output args and opts 
- Input/Output can be geojson sequences; allows for stream processing

0.9.2
- added __version__ attribute

0.9.0
- Completely removed osgeo.ogr in favor of fiona
- Completely removed osgeo.osr, spatial referencing is external to this module
- Removed optional dependency on GeoRaster lib
- Extensive cleanup of tests
- Extensive refactoring to encapsulate coordinate transforms and data access
- Use of affine lib instead of GDAL-style geotransform tuples
- Support for category maps to get human readable keys for categorical rasters
- Greatly improve speed of categorical and any stat requiring pixel counts
- Simplified and sped up travis builds for faster feedback
- Nones instead on nans returned when polygon doesn't intersect raster pixels
- Removed deprecated rasterstats script and unused util functions
- Added support for `nodata` count
- GeoJSON features and geometries accepted as CLI inputs
- point_query function and CLI
- fixed bug in zonal_stats points with all_touched
- GeoJSON Feature output supported directly, geojson_out=True

0.8.0
- Rasterio CLI plugin; rio zonalstats

0.7.2
- install bug, completely remove GDAL dep

0.7.1
- Utility function to enable CLI with geojson features

0.7.0
- Removed dependency on osgeo.gdal
- Added dependency on rasterio; used for rasterizing geometries and raster reads
- Optional use of the affine library to handle transformations ala rasterio
- Use OGR fids if available
- Raise builtin Exceptions (IOError, etc) for general errors rather than RasterStatsError
- global_src_extent doesn’t require OGR vector layer, assumes full raster extent
- Optional support for GeoRaster output (http://github.com/ozak/georasters)

0.6.2
- fix bug in percentiles where feature covers only nodata values
- pep8 cleanup

0.6.1
- Use GetNextFeature to iterate over OGR layers

0.6
- Added a `percentile_q` statistic to calculate the qth percentile for each feature.
- Removed undocumented rasterstats script (may be replaced with more robust CLI tool by 1.0)
- Optional support for outputing "mini-rasters": the clipped, masked numpy array for each feature. (thanks to @ozak again!)
- Support for dynamically adding third-party stats functions - which take a masked array and return a scalar value. (thanks to @ozak)
- Additional examples and ipython notebooks in docs

0.5
- new method for clipping to raster extents, changes bbox_to_pixel_offsets to fix src_array edge cases (thanks @allhailwesttexas and @timcera)

0.4
- Added examples directory with ipython notebooks
- proper pip requirements files
- Deprecated `raster_stats` in favor of `zonal_stats`
- Support for GeoJSON-like FeatureCollections (any things that implements FeatureCollections in the __geo_interface__)
- Support for in-memory numpy arrays and geopandas dataframes

0.3.5
- Add optional "all_touched" rasterization strategy whereby all pixels that touch a geometry are considered (thanks @ozak)

0.3.4
- Gaurd against touching (but not overlapping) polygons. Fixes #27... thanks @engelmannjens

0.3.3
- Create in-memory layer with proper spatial reference object
- don't call ogr.UseExceptions unless needed
